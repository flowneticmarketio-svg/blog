Title: Quantum Entanglement in Photon Pairs

Quantum entanglement is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. 
In this study, we generated entangled photon pairs using a nonlinear crystal and measured their correlations under varying conditions.

The results show strong agreement with Bell's theorem violations, confirming the non-local nature of quantum mechanics. 
Potential applications include quantum computing, ultra-secure communication (quantum cryptography), and advanced sensing techniques.

Key Findings:
1. Correlation measurements exceeded classical limits.
2. Entanglement remained stable up to 12 meters in free space.
3. Data suggest potential for integration into quantum networks.

Conclusion:
Entanglement is not only a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics but also a cornerstone for future technologies that may redefine information transfer and computation.
